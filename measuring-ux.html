            <p>How we created an approach to measure the effect and business impact of UX in the Co-op bank.</p>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>By the end of 2020, we set out to tackle how we could track and measure the user experience
                        across our products and services. Traditional metrics like NPS and conversion rates were
                        standard currency at the bank. These metrics made it hard for UX to measure the impact of our work. </p>
                    <p>We needed a way to prove the value of our work and we wanted to know if what we were doing
                        was actually moving the needle.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="intro__item">
                    <h3>Team</h3>
                    <p>Design lead (me), 1 UX researcher, 1 senior data analyst, 1 junior data analyst, product owners.
                    </p>

                <div class="intro__item">
                    <h3>Role</h3>
                    <p>Workshop facilitation, stakeholder management, analysis and documentation.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <h3>We couldn't measure the impact of our work</h3>
                <p>We shipped work, but we never knew the impact of that work. The bank uses metrics like the number of
                    sales, conversion rates, and NPS to measure how well we were doing. We couldn't say with any
                    certainty what effect improvments in the user experience had on these.</p>

                <h3>We were redoing the same work</h3>
                <p>Problems briefed into UX were too broad. People ended up doing the same work. Iteration was harder
                    without any success criteria.</p>

                <h3>Customer outcomes didn't drive decisions</h3>
                <p>It was hard to have an outcome-driven approach. This meant opinions and delivery dates drove
                    decisions on what to build and how.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Goals and objectives</h2>
                <p>Having taken stock of the problems we faced. We came up with three goals from which to measure the
                    success of this project.</p>

                <h3>Measure the impact of change</h3>
                <p>We wanted to prove that something had improved based on the work we'd done. Bonus points for showing
                    a return on investment.</p>

                <h3>Implement an outcome-driven design process</h3>
                <p>Have people work towards customer outcomes and measure our work against these.</p>

                <h3>Build a culture of continuous improvement</h3>
                <p>Iterate and optimise designs using data to validate outcomes.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="caption"></p>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Framework</h2>
                <p> We decided to create a framework for each product or service we wanted to measure. It covered the following criteria:
                </p>

                <h3>Product or service purpose</h3>

                <p>Defining a clear purpose helped focus people on what we wanted to measure. Any future work could also
                    start on a solid footing.
                </p>

                <h3>Business or customer benefit</h3>
                <p>Establishing clear benefits keep us thinking about the big picture. These help us gain a clear
                    understanding of why we're doing the work and who we're doing it for.
                </p>

                <h3>Outcomes: success and failure</h3>
                <p>Good and bad customer or business outcomes work in tandem with what we want to measure. Each metric
                    or KPI we track ties back to an outcome.
                </p>

                <h3>What to measure: metrics and KPIs</h3>
                <p>Metrics and KPIs reflect our progress towards an outcome or goal. They'll tell us if our work was a
                    success or failure.
                </p>

                <h3>How to measure: data source</h3>
                <p>Depending on our outcomes, our metrics and KPIs could come from a quantitative or qualitative source,
                    or both.
                </p>

                <h3>Review period</h3>
                <p>Time or volume determine a when we need to review a benchmark. Review periods keep us accountable.
                    They ensure products and services aren't lost or forgotten about.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Workshops</h2>
                <p>We facilitated workshops with stakeholders from different products and teams within the bank. We used the above framework to brainstorm ideas and voted on the most popular. The outputs got everyone on the same page and helped get stakeholders on board with the approach. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__image">
                <img src="img/workshop-outputs.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p class="caption">Workshop outputs.</p>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Baselines</h2>
                <p>After conducting a few workshops we created initial baselines for sales, fraud, and payments. We worked with the data analysts to create appropriate workspaces in adobe analytics. From here we could track our metrics and add them to our baselines.</p>
                <p>The team documented baselines in confluence given it's used by most of the bank. Using confluence meant documentation was fairly static and updating it was a manual process. Ideally, we need a way to import data automatically from adobe analytics, but this approach was fine for starting out.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The results of our work gave us a lot of encouragement to push forward with this approach and make it standard practice:</p>
                <h3>Outcomes bring clarity</h3>
                <p>Outcomes proved a useful mechanism during workshops. They encouraged people to place our customers at the heart of discussions. They also helped highlight the effect good research and design had on business and customer needs.</p>

                <h3>Continuous improvement</h3>
                <p>The act of measuring and reporting on the user experience promotes a culture of continuous improvement. Creating baselines for our work meant we could share successful designs and insight between our products and services.</p>

                <h3>Product vs service metrics</h3>
                <p>Metrics were a mixture of what users did and what users said. Product metrics were more straightforward: conversion rates, sales, abandonment rate, etc.</p>
                <p>Service metrics needed a bit more work. Uncovering meaningful outcomes and metrics that had both customer and business value took a bit more effort. In the end, we used a combination of qualitative and quantitative to get the insight we needed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>In closing</h2>
                <p>Launching a business insight tool like this ended up being a gratifying experience. The project team fully bought into the value of what we were trying to do. Their enthusiasm bled into stakeholder workshops which turned out some great insight and collaboration.</p>
                <p>Future plans include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using these baselines to increase the visibility of UX in the bank,</li>
                    <li>Looking across channels at multi signal metrics (like app store reviews vs NPS),</li>
                    <li>Measuring the effect social media or marketing campaigns have on our baseline metrics and KPIs.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
