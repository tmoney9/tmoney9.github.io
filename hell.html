      <h3>Hell Pizza are a New Zealand based pizza chain. They wanted a mobile app that would offer their customers a faster way to get their pizza. I was part of a project to redesign their existing mobile experience.</h3>

      <h3 class="title">My Role</h3>
      <p>This project took place between February 2016 and December 2016. I worked on this project as an Interaction Designer at PaperKite alongside another Designer, Creative Director, Product Analyst and two iOS Developers. </p>
      <p>Our responsibilities in the design team included research, product strategy, interaction design, visual design, copywriting, prototyping and motion design.</p>

      <h3 class="title">The Challenge: A Faster Route to Hell</h3>
      <p>Our client approached us with two primary objectives —to improve upon their current app by offering customers a native experience with a strong brand presence and give people the ability to quickly and easily re-order their favourite food. The app’s
        launch was to coincide with Hell’s twentieth anniversary later that year giving the team a strict but achievable deadline.</p>

      <h3 class="title">Research & Discovery</h3>
      <p>The discovery phase was a high intensity exercise that allowed us to audit the existing app, review the competition, understand our client’s vision and start initial research into user needs, pain points and goals. At the same time the tech team
        kicked off their own discovery phase looking into the constraints and viability of what could be done.</p>

      <p>Our research revealed that our app had to cater for a whole host of features that were considered standard in the industry which meant the scope for doing something groundbreaking had diminished considerably. </p>

      <h3 class="title">Our Approach: Focusing on Goals</h3>
      <p>We started the project with a full day workshop with the client. Stakeholder interviews are fine but getting the client involved in a full day of exercises and activities really helped us get a more wholesome understanding of our client’s problems
        and goals. We stressed upon the client the importance of focusing on goals and outcomes rather than getting embroiled in a feature war with competitors. </p>

      <p>The workshop helped us discover relevant user personas as well as key user journeys that would go on to define some of the app’s main experiences. It also sparked a tonne of great ideas that created a sense of ownership across both teams. </p>

      <p>Sharing our methods and thinking from the outset helped build a strong relationship with the client and kept them involved in all major and minor decisions moving forward. </p>

      <h3 class="title">Starting Lean</h3>
      <p>We started with a lean approach which centered around rapid sketching, wireframes and prototyping. This allowed us to drill down on the many early concepts and present back to the client our recommended direction and phased approach for the app.
        Many of our recommendations stemmed from our initial workshop with the client which helped us construct a shared vision for the app.</p>

      <p>We worked in five day sprints, setting design goals on Monday and presenting designs as we saw fit. We also opened a slack channel with the client giving them ample opportunity to provide feedback and share ideas as we progressed through the design
        phase. </p>

      <p>Our workflow relied on on a range of tools such as whiteboards, Sketch, Illustrator, Zeplin, Invision and Principle. The star of the show was Principle. It allowed us to quickly mock up realistic prototypes and motion designs to get a feel for the
        interaction or transition and present to the engineering team.</p>

      <h3 class="title">Finding the Right Balance</h3>
      <p>Redesigning Hell Pizza was an exercise in balance. From the customers point of view we had to strike the right note of keeping all features from the existing app while making it faster and more enjoyable to order food. The client wanted to use the
        new app as a channel to build customer relationships as well as advertise to these customers and the brand requirements meant the unique visual style had to be intuitive and straightforward.</p>

      </figure>

      <h3 class="title">Welcome to Hell</h3>
      <p>The main screen was designed to give people quick access to primary functions of the app. The main purpose of the app was to order food so this was given centre stage. People could see promotions by scrolling just below the fold and ‘Last Order’
        let people quickly get their most recent order.</p>

      <h3 class="title">Leveraging Native Hardware</h3>
      <p>Where possible we leveraged the power of the device and removed some complexity from the user such as using location services to determine their nearest store and push notifications to alert users of relevant promotions. A gesture based menu let
        people quickly flick between categories and filtering let people tailor the menu to their own taste.</p>

      <h3 class="title">Customisation</h3>
      <p>We bucked a few trends when it came to customising your pizza. A fairly unconventional slider (later replaced for something more conventional) was used to choose pizza size and style. We went for this under the remit of making interactions more
        fun and less mechanical. The amount of customisations available per menu item also meant there was a bit of a learning curve with some of the controls —in hindsight it may have been useful to add a degree of onboarding in context to some of these.</p>

      <h3 class="title">Designed for Delight</h3>
      <p>The interface design strived to be unique and opinionated rather than being clean and minimal. This was deliberate and reflected the values of the business. The typography is custom and while the colours pass accessibility standards we could have
        opted for higher contrast and fewer decorative elements. All our design decisions helped give off a sense of delight which resonated with existing customers and our client.</p>

      <h3 class="title">Testing & Refining</h3>
      <p>In the weeks after launch we discovered some clarity issues during the ordering process and drunk orders lacking a safety net —leading to quite a few hungover complaints. Sometimes the addition of ‘friction’ in a design is necessary to catch some
        of these use cases. A relatively tight budget meant there was no room for user testing during prototyping which may have caught a few of these problems early on.</p>

      <p>We also found that forcing users to use a number of entirely new UI patterns was pretty rough and took a step back with some of these components. That said there is always room for trying something different and out of the ordinary. </p>

      <h3 class="title">Apps are Never Finished</h3>
      <p>After a slow start, adoption rates started to increase with a lot of the earlier issues and bugs getting ironed out. An app this size was never going to be perfect for first launch and needed to be put in peoples hands to identify pain points and
        usability issues. Although I don’t have any statistics on app usage or sales, the client expressed their happiness on how the app was performing and remained committed to continue learning and improving the app in the future.</p>
