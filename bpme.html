      <h3>In 2015, BP changed the way people paid for fuel: BPMe —Australia and New Zealand's first fuel payment App. The next step was to do the same with coffee.</h3>

      <h3 class="title">My Role</h3>
      <p>I was part of the design team at PaperKite that handled research, product strategy, user testing and interaction design between December 2015 and September 2017.
      </p>
      <p>We worked alongside a Product Director, Technical Director, two Product Mangers, Quality Assurance and three teams of Engineers; Back End, Android and iOS.</p>
      <p>In addition, the wider PaperKite team collaborated with product teams from BP New Zealand and BP Australia.</p>

      <h3 class="title">Where we Were</h3>
      <p>With BPMe in the public domain for just over a year it came to our attention that around 50% of people were using the app for Wild Bean Cafe —BP’s on site coffee shops.</p>
      <p>We wanted to offer these people a way to streamline their own BP experience thus making BPMe more valuable to them. This project was to be the next step towards an all-inclusive BPMe.
      </p>

      <h3 class="title">The Challenge: A Faster Fix</h3>
      <p>One of the main friction points when it came to ordering coffee at Wild Bean was waiting in line before placing an order. The aim was to eliminate this problem by having users go straight to the pickup point. From there people would complete their order by paying at the counter and scanning their loyalty card.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Our high level goals were:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Make it quick and simple to order a coffee,</li>
        <li>Let people customise their coffee to their personal taste,</li>
        <li>Create a platform that could scale and adapt to future versions.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class="title">Caught in the Crossfire</h3>
      <p>Early insights made us realise that this fanciful idea, while great news for the user, had a few logistical problems for Wild Bean staff. BP and PaperKite set up a few working sessions with staff and baristas to understand the challenges they faced in store.</p>

      <p>What we found out was that staff were reluctant to add more steps to their current workflow and whatever solution we came up with needed to integrate into their existing system as smoothly as possible. In Wild Bean Cafe the cup was king —everything about the order was written on the cup as the customer announced it. Keeping this in mind was integral to finding a solution that would work for everyone.</p>

      <p>After the session we did some field research into how other coffee shops handled orders and eventually agreed on a sticker with the order details that would be printed and attached to the coffee cup. In addition, we’d create a Point of Sale interface as a fallback that would show order details and upcoming orders from BPMe.</p>

      <h3 class="title">Getting Started</h3>
      <p>The client set an aggressive launch date for the product that would coincide with a national marketing campaign. In favour of speed to market we broke the product into phases that started with Minimum Marketable Product (MMP) and phases two and three beyond that.   </p>

      <p>The assumption was simple —that people would rather preorder their coffee than queue up for it. From there we set out to ensure that there were as few steps to order as possible along with the ability to personalise a drink. </p>

      <p>Deadlines were tight from the get go. We had pencilled in user testing for week three of the design phase. The design team went hard at it sketching, wireframing and prototyping. By the time user testing came around we had three prototypes we wanted to get some opinions on. </p>

      <h3 class="title">User Insights</h3>
      <p>We conducted seven interviews with existing Wild Bean customers over two days which gleaned some important design and product insights. We were also able to discover new information that helped strengthen our user personas. In hindsight it might have been better to get a more diverse sample (a few new customers) but we took what we got. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Some of the main insights were:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Customers were likely to use this product if it saved them time</li>
        <li>Customers expected the quality of the coffee to remain the same regardless of how they ordered it</li>
        <li>Being able to personalise a drink and quickly reorder it was appreciated</li>
        <li>Their was an expectation that real time status information was available for their order</li>
        <li>Various user experience details that people found confusing or unnecessary</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="title">The Gift of Time</h3>
      <p>Our vision for Wild Bean Coffee Ordering was for people to save time at Wild Bean Cafes. We didn’t want to offer an exhaustive menu that would require a shopping cart experience. </p>
      <p>Together with being able to pay for fuel with BPMe we wanted to provide value by giving back to customers time in their busy lives.</p>

      <h3 class="title">A Place for Coffee</h3>
      <p>The Wild Bean tab lets customers preorder coffees and view their coffee count. Customers who have already placed a Wild Bean order will see their last order here and be able to quickly reorder.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>The menu shows all available drinks sorted by popularity. Customers can then select a size or customise their drink. We kept main actions here in the thumb zone to help with one handed use. Contextual onboarding was also used to highlight areas like 'customise', which wasn't obvious to some users during testing. </p>

      <p>Users would see a final order confirmation screen before completing their order. Here they could add additional drinks or schedule their order for a later pickup.</p>

      <h3 class="title">Launch</h3>
      <p>In October 2017 Coffee Ordering launched to select sites across New Zealand. In the end it was a remarkable achievement by both teams in getting it to market in around six months. It’s still early days for this product and future features are likely going to improve it’s utility in a big way. It represents a more human focused shift in an industry that is going to look a whole lot different in the near future. </p>
