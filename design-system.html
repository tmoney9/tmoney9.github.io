                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>When I joined the Coop Bank we were using Sketch and Jira for our design-to-development pipeline. Design files lived on people's local machines with no single source of truth. This lead to a lack of cohesion among our products and made collaboration between teams challenging.</p>
                    <p>In 8 months we built and launched 'Daly', the banks design system. We moved every team off Sketch and onto Figma. Figma was a big enabler for the bank. It helped us build an expansive design system that was accessible to the entire organisation. This case study is a simplified account on how we created Daly. </p>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>Before launching our design system there were three major problems we wanted to tackle.</p>
                <p>The first was that all our products and services looked and felt very different. We had 18 different types of buttons, 10 different alert style and 7 different shades of our brand blue. Depending on how people were banking with us, this resulted in a wildly different experience.</p>
                <p>Our slow inefficient design process was another big problem. It took us an age to design and ship new screens because we started everything from scratch. On top of that every time we updated a design, we had to export a new PDF and upload it to Jira. The existing process was a major drag on designer productivity.</p>
                <p>The last major problem was our development process. Our dev teams were working on 11 platforms. They were building designs on a page-by-page basis, often recreating the same component again and again. We estimated that the cost of these duplicate efforts for a single button was over £12K. We'd hoped the design system could speed up execution and lower development cost.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Discovery</h2>
                <p>The Coop Bank has a range of products and services for retail and business customers. We kicked off by gathering user feedback about our current design. A lot of the feedback was useful in validating the need for a more cohesive experience:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"The page is very busy, there's a lot going on"</li>
                    <li>"I don't use the mobile app, it's very different to online banking"</li>
                    <li>"Clunky and difficult to navigate"</li>
                    <li>"Weird non-standard interface"</li>
                    <li>"It looks quite dated"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Next, we took stock of the current experience. We collected and categorised every component that made up our digital experience. We wanted to show off all the glaring inconsistencies in our products and services. The audit also gave the design team an idea of what components and patterns were being used.</p>
                <p>Finally, we spoke to developers, brand, sales, content managers, product owners, QA engineers, among others. The idea was to gather different points of view on how a design system could help in their daily lives.</p>
            </div>
           
            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>How we did it</h2>
                <p>Daly ended up being a collection of different systems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A  system of platform agnostic design tokens,</li>
                    <li>A Zeroheight site for documentation,</li>
                    <li>A Figma file with styles, components and patterns,</li>
                    <li>A React component library for web,</li>
                    <li>Native iOS and Android component libraries.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each system was a tool for a different audience. Tokens for designers and developers, documentation for content managers and development libraries for product teams. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Principles</h2>
                <p>Before diving in, we needed to decide on our core beliefs. The team got together and ran a few ideation exercises to find out what we believed were important rules to follow. We came up with these principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tokens over specs</li>
                    <li>Clarity over depth</li>
                    <li>Content over graphics</li>
                    <li>Feedback over expertise</li>
                    <li>Evidence over tradition</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These principles were something we could lean on to make decisions. They were also an attempt at changing how work was traditionally tackled at the bank. Our aim were that these principles were pragmatic and useful as opposed to abstract and idealistic. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Design tokens</h2>
                <p>Design tokens are a way to keep our products and services looking and feeling the same while making development faster. They allow us to provide developers and designers with a shared visual language, regardless of what language they code or design in. We stored values for typography, colour, spacing and layout as tokens.</p>
                <p>Daly ended up having a few different 'flavours'. In-house teams helped develop more complete flavours such as those for React, iOS and Android. The bank also outsources a lot of its development to third parties. We used design tokens as a way to maintain a degree of consistency across these third-party platforms.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__image">

            </div>
            <p class="caption">How design tokens functioned in Daly.</p>
            
            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Content</h2>
                <p>Content was a big part of Daly. We started to think as content in the same way we thought about UI components and patterns. Backed by research, our content designers drafted guidelines on how to create, write and use different types of content. Systemising our content turned Daly into a pretty effective content designer. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Speeding up our process</h2>
                <p>Before Daly, we didn't have a place designers could go to see and use existing components. Designers and developers made decisions based on our existing products and services, which lead to even more inconsistencies.</p>
                <p>To combat inconsistencies, and speed up our process, the design team created a component library. This Figma file houses every style and component we use in Daly. Designers can drag and drop components into their own projects without the need to reinvent the wheel every time.</p>
                <p>Developers used the component library, along with the design tokens, to create component repositories. These repos lived on Bitbucket, meaning other teams within the bank could use them. We used React to build components and Storybook for documentation.</p>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Building from a solid base</h2>
                <p>We pitched Daly on the basis that everything we built had a high degree of confidence baked in. We used usability testing to continuously validate our design decisions. Components that made the cut went through quality assurance to meet strict AA accessibility guidelines.</p>
                <p>We care a lot about accessibility at the bank. We want anyone to be able to use our products and services. A disability or an impairment shouldn’t stop someone accessing our website, app or online tools. Daly helps product teams comply with accessibility standards effortlessly. Previously, accessibility was an afterthought. With Daly, it's central to everything we deliver. </p>
                <p>Having this kind of rigour in our process gave teams a robust library of components to choose from. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Documentation</h2>
                <p>Documentation was a must-have for our design system. Our aim was for Daly to be more than a component library used by designers and developers. We wanted to empower anyone at the bank to make consistent, efficient decisions on design and content. We included things like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Good and bad practice,</li>
                    <li>Do's and don'ts,</li>
                    <li>Alternative or related solutions,</li>
                    <li>Research findings,</li>
                    <li>How to write for.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Putting the extra effort into documentation elevated Daly beyond a reference site and into a tool that teams could integrate into their daily workflow.  </p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Lessons learnt </h2>
                <h3>Adoption</h3>
                <p>Since it's launch, Daly has had a mixed level of adoption across our eleven product teams. We realised shortly after release that bulding and launching the system is only the start.</p>
                <p>Our release plan included presentations and training for every affected team. This helped create some momentum straight after launch but things slowed down after that.</p>
                <p>Rather than force adoption, we partnered with teams who were migrating to newer tech stacks. Different front-end tech stacks meant some teams could adopt more quickly.  Most, however, struggled to incorporate Daly into their existing workflows and workload. We had to adjust our expectations of mass adoption and go for something more incremental.</p>

                <h3>Measuring the value</h3>
                <p>Our ultimate goal for Daly was for it to become a standalone product team. While we could justify the rationale, we needed a way to be able to prove the value in a way that’s meaningful to the business. This lead us to the question: how do we measure the value of a design system?</p>
                <p>Designers and developers knew the value. They could speak to their experience working with a design system vs without. We needed a way to prove this value to the business using metrics they understood, like reduced cost, or time saved building a feature.</p>
                <p>Like adoption, measuring the value of Daly is something we're still working on. We're looking at agile estimates for shipped features as something we could compare against. While the anecdotal evidence is there, not working to create consistent baseline to measure against didn't help our cause.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Evolution over time</h2>
                <p>A design system is never done. Brand aesthetics change, patterns and components evolve, and front-end frameworks get updated. Design systems need to be able to adapt and grow.</p>
                <p>Post-launch, the team spent some time thinking about where we go from here. While measuring and adoption is a longer game, we identified some operational improvements to tackle sooner:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An approach for onboarding and training new starters,</li>
                    <li>A support workflow for issues and requests,</li>
                    <li>A process for governance and contributing,</li>
                    <li>A communication plan for updates and releases,</li>
                    <li>Making Daly 'official' in the bank.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>In closing</h2>
                <p>Daly was one of the most enjoyable and challenging projects I worked on at the bank. Building a design system from scratch with a team of dedicated peers was a really great experience. This was a true grassroots effort and ended up creating something of real value to the bank. </p>
