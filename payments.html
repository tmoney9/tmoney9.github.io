                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>The payment flow is one of the Co-op Bank's core experiences with hundreds of thousands of people
                        using it every month. It must cater to both first-time users and those who use it several times
                        a
                        week. </p>
                    <p> The existing flow had remained largely unchanged for over 5 years. There were also significant
                        differences in the experience depending on the platform a customer was making a payment.
                    </p>
                    <p> The design team explored a new flow that simplified the experience and unified the payment flow
                        across different platforms.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>On the face of it, the payment flow is just a basic form. Users would enter the necessary details and
                    submit them to make a payment. We had an opportunity to elevate it beyond that to bring it more in
                    line with industry standards.</p>
                <p>We conducted some initial usability testing to baseline the current experience. The payment flow
                    performed relatively well with some existing customers. Customers who banked elsewhere, however,
                    felt it was 'clunky' and 'outdated'.</p>
                <p>There was also an opportunity to align our technical architecture across platforms. This meant the
                    tech team could use the same microservices for both platforms over maintaining separate ones for the
                    same service.</p>
                <p>Finally, we had to implement a regulatory feature (confirmation of payee) that facilitated safer
                    payments. At the time of design there were no industry standards for this service.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Hypotheses</h2>
                <p>The team got together and came up with a main hypotheses to test:</p>
                <p>If we break the flow into smaller chunks, we will reduce cognitive load and simplify the payment
                    process for new and repeat users. We planned on validating this hypothesis using qualitative
                    usability testing initially. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Competitor analysis</h2>
                <p>Our researcher carried out a competitor analysis to find out how other banks handled payments. There
                    wasn't much variance in the industry in regards to the general steps to make a payment. Stand-out
                    payment journeys focused on good interaction design to improve the journey. We used the analysis to
                    benchmark our redesign against.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Task analysis</h2>
                <p>To better understand the current payment flow, we mapped every step a user currently goes through to
                    complete their goal. We opted for a task analysis because it showed every activity from beginning to
                    end. This way we could demonstrate the complexity of the existing payment flow and seek out
                    opportunities on a more granular level.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Confirmation of Payee (CoP)</h2>
                <p>CoP is a name-checking service that makes sure payments are being sent to the right account. It
                    verifies a person's details with that person's bank and flags incorrect details. The purpose is to
                    stop certain types of payment fraud.</p>
                <p>The implication from a project perspective was integrating this step into the payment flow. We
                    iterated on this step the most, even testing with people who were victims of fraud to get their
                    feedback.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>New user flow</h2>
                <p>Following the research, the team mapped user flows for the different payment services. There were a
                    few different scenarios we needed to design for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Paying a new payee,</li>
                    <li>Paying an existing payee,</li>
                    <li>Transferring money between accounts,</li>
                    <li>Paying off a credit card,</li>
                    <li>Scheduling a payment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our new user flow broke the service into smaller more logical steps. Each step focused on one aspect
                    of the service. This meant we could design each scenario from a collection of predefined steps.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Prototyping</h2>
                <p>With a preliminary set of scenarios to assess, we set about creating a prototype for usability
                    testing. We mocked everything up in Figma and used that for usability testing.</p>
                <p>Given the basic nature of Figma prototypes, we adjusted our expectations for what we wanted to get
                    from the first round of testing. We looked at things like comprehension, ease of task and how secure
                    people felt the service was.</p>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Usability feedback</h2>
                <p>In all, the team conducted three rounds of usability testing with 18 users. We tested with a similar
                    demographic as the baseline test. The findings were positive:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Task success — 100%</li>
                    <li>How easy users found the task — 8/10</li>
                    <li>How secure users found the task — 8/10</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We took the results with a pinch of salt, given their subjective nature and the relative simplicity
                    of the prototype. It did, however, give us enough confidence to move forward with our concept. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Results and learning</h2>
                <p>Overall we were happy with the results. The project took around 6 weeks from beginning to end. Going
                    through multiple rounds of usability testing helped validate and reduce the risk of our design
                    decisions. It also gave the business peace of mind that this pretty sizeable redesign was the
                    direction to go.</p>
                <p>Some of our main takeaways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Breaking the payment flow into smaller parts helped scale the service to different platforms.
                    </li>
                    <li>The component nature of the approach helped engineers develop a cleaner back-end solution.</li>
                    <li>The redesign brought the payment service in line with industry conventions.</li>
                    <li>CoP increased user agency during the payment process. </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>In closing</h2>
                <p>Having the opportunity to redesign our payment service was a rewarding experience for many reasons. Having multiple rounds of usability testing also let move fast and make decisions without having to through the usual bureaucratic process.  </p>

                <p>We were also able to simplify one of the bank's core experiences and laid the foundation for new functionality to be added in future iterations.</p>
