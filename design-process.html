        <p>Hi Angela,</p>
        <p>
          I split this account into two parts by project to better illustrate
          the end-to-end process I used. The first project is still ongoing, so
          this section will end before going into detailed design. The second
          project will cover that topic.

            Project 1: IA and nav redesign — Research → Prototype
          </p>
          <p class="tagline text-m text-medium">Origins of this project</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            During the last quarter, one of our OKRs was to propose a redesign
            for our app's navigation. This goal arose from feedback we received
            during user interviews and the need to accommodate numerous new
            features in our roadmap.
          </p>
          <p>
            The IA and nav redesign project aims to provide a more scalable and
            efficient way to find a feature or setting within our app.
          </p>
          <p class="tagline text-m text-medium">Understanding user behaviour</p>
          <p>
            The design process began with analysing our existing user data to
            better understand how they currently navigate our app. During the
            previous quarter, we ran qualitative user interviews with users as a
            collaborative journey mapping exercise. These research sessions led
            to a general understanding of our user's mental models and how they
            were using our app.
          </p>
          <div class="job-thumb">
            <img src="img/design-process/journey-map.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            We learnt that most research participants had similar frustrations
            when navigating our app:
          </p>
          <ol class="post-numbered">
            <li>
              Most participants found it difficult to pick up where they left
              off.
            </li>
            <li>
              Participants only used one or two items from the main nav,
              suggesting there was a bit of redundancy there.
            </li>
            <li>
              The relationships between objects didn't make sense, for example
              pipeline and interactive notebooks sat under projects, but cohorts
              didn't. There was no rationale for this.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nav items were displayed as icons, but users were unable to link
              the icons to specific pages or features within the app.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, one participant was quoted as saying “I dread having to
              relearn everything, because I always forget where it is.”
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
          On top of the user frustrations mentioned above, our PM brought a
          couple business problems to the table:
        </p>
        <ol class="post-numbered">
          <li>
            Existing architecture wasn't scalable, new features had nowhere to
            go.
          </li>
          <li>
            Workspace settings became a dumping ground for related and unrelated
            settings. This is something we wanted the redesign to solve.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="job-thumb">
          <img src="img/design-process/existing-app-map.png" alt="" />
        </div>

        <p class="tagline text-m text-medium">Defining scope and goals</p>
        <p>
          After the initial data analysis, we checked in with the project team
          to converge on the scope of the project and the goals we wanted to
          set. The team was made up of myself, a PM, a senior designer, and a UX
          researcher.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rearchitecting our app and redesigning our main nav naturally meant
          the scope was pretty wide. However, our existing technical
          architecture meant our existing hierarchy needed to remain largely
          unchanged. In addition, we decided not to change any existing features
          as part of this project, instead picking them up as separate
          initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          From here we converged on three goals we wanted this project to
          address:
        </p>
        <ol class="post-numbered">
          <li>
            Create a scalable system: Future proof our information architecture
            so our software can continue to scale.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eliminate friction: Reduce the steps it takes for a user to jump
            back in to their previous workflow.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improve accessibility and visual design: Make it clear to users
            where to go and pave the way for a new visual style for the app.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="tagline text-m text-medium">Exploratory research</p>

        <p>
          To gain a better understanding of the problem space, we conducted
          several research activities:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Heuristic analysis:</strong> we evaluated our exiting
          navigation against some best-practice usability principles to see how
          it compared.
        </p>
        <div class="job-thumb">
          <img src="img/design-process/heuristic-analysis.png" alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          <strong>Competitor and wider market analysis:</strong> During the
          first round of market analysis, we focused on how competitors and
          market leaders structured their information. We primarily evaluated
          elements such as hierarchy, labelling, and nested links.
        </p>

        <div class="job-thumb">
          <img src="img/design-process/heuristic-analysis.png" alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          <strong>Card sorting with existing users:</strong> We conducted
          several card sorting activities to help us gain a more nuanced
          understanding of how our users categorised the content in our app.
          These were run as asynchronous workshops with a range of user cohorts.
        </p>

        <div class="job-thumb">
          <img src="img/design-process/card-sort.png" alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          The team then gathered for another sync to discuss the findings from
          this phase. At this point, there were no decisions to be made beyond
          whether we are satisfied with the amount of research done and whether
          to proceed with the project.
        </p>

        <p>
          The most relevant findings were captured as ideas for the design
          phase.
        </p>

        <p class="tagline text-m text-medium">Designing a new app map</p>

        <p>
          After deepening our understanding of the problem space, we set about
          modelling our own system and figuring out the relationships between
          the different entities (or objects) that exist within it. For this we
          used a technique called object mapping (from OOUX).
        </p>

        <p>
          The purpose of this was to identify the different objects in our
          system, as our users understood them, and map how they relate to one
          another. Using this method we were able to synthesise the findings
          from the research phase into a clear structure with clear
          relationships, that aligned to our user's mental models.
        </p>

        <div class="job-thumb">
          <img src="img/design-process/object-map.png" alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Once we had structured our objects, we proceeded to map them to a new
          application map. The purpose of this was to visually illustrate the
          hierarchy of our objects. Compared to the previous app map, the
          proposed design had more hierarchy, which in turn made it more
          scalable.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also included suggestions for labelling and moving various objects
          to new locations that aligned with the research findings from the
          previous phase.
        </p>

        <div class="job-thumb">
          <img src="img/design-process/proposed-app-map.png" alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>A note here:</p>
        <p>
          At this point I would usually validate this app map against our
          previous one using a tree test. We proposed this approach to the
          project manager. However, due to the project deadline, we decided to
          perform all of our testing during the navigation redesign phase. We
          had a reasonable level of confidence in our proposed redesign, which
          was bolstered by the research findings.
        </p>

        <p class="tagline text-m text-medium">Phase 2 — Navigation redesign</p>

        <p>
          The second phase of this project was to apply our redesigned app map
          to our product and test it. We kicked this off by going back to
          research, specifically looking at navigation patterns that different
          apps used. Our analysis mainly looked at the visual treatment of these
          patterns and their placement or location within the app's interface.
        </p>

        <div class="job-thumb">
          <img src="img/design-process/market-analysis.png" alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          We mainly looked at successful SAAS applications with high user bases.
          The objective being to propel our own app to their level knowing that
          these apps are battle tested and designed by teams far bigger than our
          own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using this analysis we were able to define some guiding principles for
          our redesign:
        </p>
        <ol class="post-numbered">
          <li>
            Preserve the sidebar navigation, these popular among data heavy
            apps.
          </li>
          <li>Use icons and labels for navigation items.</li>
          <li>Include an avatar or initials for the account link.</li>
          <li>
            Implement contextual navigation items based on the page or level.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure the first page a user sees when they log in is relevant based
            on where they left off or where they came from.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide alternative ways for users to move between pages, instead of
            relying solely on the main navigation.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="tagline text-m text-medium">Sketching and wireframes</p>

        <p>
          After agreeing on the design principles for the project, we focused on
          turning our ideas into something more tangible. First, we elaborated
          on our object maps from the previous phase by adding all the extra
          details within these objects:
        </p>
        <ul class="post-list">
          <li>Call to actions</li>
          <li>User generated content</li>
          <li>Metadata or system generated content</li>
          <li>Nested or related objects</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="job-thumb">
          <img src="img/design-process/object-map-expanded.png" alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          From there we started arranging these object maps spatially into
          content wireframes. This gave us the full view of all the pages we
          needed to cater for and a rough idea of where the content might sit on
          the page.
        </p>

        <div class="job-thumb">
          <img src="img/design-process/content-wireframes.png" alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Finally we added a bit more fidelity to these wireframes to explore
          different nav patterns and have a more useful artefact to present to
          stakeholders.
        </p>

        <div class="job-thumb">
          <img src="img/design-process/wireframes.png" alt="" />
        </div>

        <p class="tagline text-m text-medium">Prototyping and testing</p>

        <p>
          After several rounds of iterations and discussions with the PM, we
          made the decision to develop and test three different prototypes. To
          ensure that people's focus was on tasks and structure instead of
          visual design elements, we chose to test prototypes that were devoid
          of any colour or branding.
        </p>

        <div class="job-thumb">
          <img src="img/design-process/prototypes.png" alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Although we developed three different prototypes, they were all built
          using the redesigned app map. The nuance was in the different nav
          patterns used to indicate the different hierarchies. Option 1 (left)
          proposed a more focused and stricter hierarchy, whereas Option 2
          (centre), and 3 (right) facilitated quicker switching between projects
          and workspaces.
        </p>

        <p>
          These were just a couple of the assumptions we wanted to validate
          during usability testing.
        </p>

        <div class="job-thumb">
          <img src="img/design-process/options.png" alt="" />
        </div>

        <p class="tagline text-m text-medium">Next steps</p>

        <p>
          This project is still ongoing and we're currently conducting
          unmoderated usability testing using Maze. The test was designed as a
          summative usability test so that we could benchmark prototypes against
          each other.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also included some standard survey questions to evaluate such as
          task satisfaction and ease of use. Our aim is to test with at least
          twenty research participants all of which are active users. From there
          we'll converge on a single solution and do some more moderated
          usability testing.
        </p>

        <p class="tagline text-m text-medium">A predictable cadence</p>

        <p>
          I wanted to call out our approach to meetings throughout this project.
          Lifebit has somewhat of an anti-meeting culture so we set out to
          define the cadence and format of our meetings at the start of the
          project.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of having meetings that aligned with the stages of the
          project, we opted for a more frequent cadence of bi-weekly synchs that
          were 15-20 minutes long. Each meeting had clear recommendations from
          the design team based on data gathered from previous round which fed
          the actions for the next round of work.
        </p>

        <div class="profile">
          <p class="name text-l text-bold">
            Project 2 – Detailed design and hand-off
          </p>
          <p>
            The second project I want to mention covers the detailed design
            phase and implementation phase.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="tagline text-m text-medium">Drafting user stories</p>
        <p>
          Usually at this point in the process, we had a clear understanding of
          the problem and opportunities we were going to address. With that in
          mind, our next step in the process was to draft user stories.
        </p>

        <p>
          As with many organisations using SCRUM, these user stories are
          developer focused, and not used as a tool for ideating or exploratory
          design. At Lifebit we use them to capture as much detail as possible
          so an engineer can pick it up without much fuss.
        </p>

        <p>
          They also ensure the team remains on the same page. From a design
          point of view it helps me align flows and relevant documentation to
          the corresponding user story.
        </p>

        <p class="tagline text-m text-medium">Detailed design</p>

        <p>
          The detailed design phase typically consists of designing every screen
          state and relevant user flow. I tend to break hand-off documents into
          pages and components. Generally, I will go overboard with specs and
          documentation as it helps me catch any missing edge cases and provides
          engineers with a robust starting point.
        </p>

        <div class="job-thumb">
          <img src="img/design-process/page-specs.png" alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          How I create hand-off documents is an ever evolving process of
          feedback and refinement. One thing I've found quite helpful recently
          is working with engineers to develop a token library. Engineers don't
          have to worry about hardcoding values and designers can be sure
          mockups are developed to spec.
        </p>

        <div class="job-thumb">
          <img src="img/design-process/component-specs.png" alt="" />
        </div>

        <p class="tagline text-m text-medium">Implementing the new designs</p>

        <p>
          Once we've completed the detailed design phase, it's typical for us to
          schedule a design review session with the engineers and project
          managers. During this session, we can discuss any potential issues,
          solicit feedback, and ensure that everyone is aligned before moving
          forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          This might be the first time some engineers see the mockups. How we
          tend to work at Lifebit is we include a representative from the tech
          team during ideation and design who validates the feasibility of the
          designs.
        </p>

        <p>
          After delivering the work to the engineers, my focus shifts to
          providing design support. This role extends until the product launch,
          and my primary goal is to help unblock the engineers as quickly as
          possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          The last part of the process before launch is the design QA step. This
          gives the baton back to the designer to review the implemented designs
          and report any gaps or issues. At Lifebit, this step ends with
          approval or sign-off from the designer. After which it can be moved
          into production.
        </p>

        <p class="tagline text-m text-medium">Build, measure, learn?</p>

        <p>
          A final word on our our current process at Lifebit. While we have a
          mechanism for capturing qualitative feedback during the early stages,
          we don't yet have a robust analytical framework in place to measure
          features after launch. This is a symptom of our current maturity and
          something we're working towards implementing.
        </p>

          The reason I mention it is, in the past, this wouldn't have been the
          end of the design process. Generally we'd launch features with
          relevant quantitive metrics that we could review at certain
          milestones. From there we'd make a decision to either iterate on the
          feature or investigate why it hasn't worked as we expected.
