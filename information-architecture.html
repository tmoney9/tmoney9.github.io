                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>The bank's web and mobile apps historically functioned as separate product teams with little awareness of one
                        another. Both had their own unique roadmap despite being the same product.</p>
                    <p>The plan for 2020 was to redesign and re-platform the web app, with mobile coming shortly after. The UX team used
                        this as an opportunity to align the IA and product strategy of both apps.</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>The current web and mobile apps were a tangled mess of features and services. New features got built
                    with little thought given to findability or organisation within the existing architecture.</p>
                <p>To increase our understanding of the problem we ran some qualitative usability testing. We conducted
                    a tree test to determine what areas of the navigation needed improvement. The team recruited 30
                    participants for the test and used Userzoom to carry it out. This helped us establish a baseline for
                    the IA on which to improve upon.</p>
                <p>The test consisted of 10 tasks. Each task focused on a major feature or service within the app, for
                    example: "Where would you go to remove a payee?".</p>
                <p>Userzoom scored each task under various findability related metrics. The output was an overall
                    effectiveness score for each task.</p>
            </div>

                <p>For the above example success was calculated at 38% with only around half of that being a direct success.

            <div class="case-study__body">

                <p>Overall results were a mixed bag. A few tasks performed relatively well, which we wanted to preserve. Others didn't do so well. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">

                <h2>Building a better IA</h2>
                <p>The team analysed the results of the tree test, and past usablity tests, and found some common themes.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unclear top level categories lead many users down the wrong path.</li>
                    <li>Similar or misleading categories that caused users to pick the wrong targets.</li>
                    <li>Categories not where users expected them to be leading to frustration and failure.</li>
                    <li>Unclear category labels that used terms that were unfamiliar to users.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Following this analysis the team conducted an open card sort test. The aim was to understand how our users categorise and understand our products and services.</p>
                <p>We asked 30 users to organise features from our app and put them into groups that made sense to them. </p>
            </div>

            <p class="caption">Results from the card sort. </p>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <p>The result was a new IA that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Brought clarity to our categories and labels by rewording them into commonly understood terms.</li>
                    <li>Took a mobile first approach by reducing the number of top level categories.</li>
                    <li>Rearranged categories into a flatter hierarchy making things easier to find.</li>
                    <li>Elevated popular features in the IA reducing users time to complete a task.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By reducing the hierarchy, users were able to find what they were looking for faster. A smaller global navigation meant users had less options to consider initially.</p>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>Measuring the results</h2>
                <p>To measure the success (or failure) of the redesign, we conducted a second tree test using the new IA. We tweaked each task to include the new labels the content designer had come up with.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__image">

            <p class="caption">A screenshot of the results for all tasks for the redesigned IA. </p>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <p>The first tree test that we baselined had an average task success of 61%. The redesign had an average success of 87% across the same 10 tasks. On top of that, the new IA was far more capable at handling new features and services down the line.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study__body">
                <h2>In closing</h2>
                <p>The IA redesign turned out to be a success. We simplified the architecture of our web and mobile apps, increasing findability and consistency. Additionally, labels were more in line with our content guidelines and user expectation.</p>
                <p>The approach we took, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, gave us a lot of confidence in the results and helped us push forward to the next stage of product development.</p>
